# The Full Monty Hall

A frivolous presentation about the Monty Hall problem, and included Ruby code to run
a simulation to show that there is a winning strategy.

# How to run the code

Install the required gems:

    bundle install

Run the simulation:

    bundle exec pry -r ./monty.rb

    > win_counts

# To do

- a little web app to show the strategies competing against each other with
  a running total of win counts
